# Git Repos Manager

Keep track of your Git repos.



#### Why Git Repos Manager?
Some of my OctoberCMS installations are divided into multiples git repos (main installation, theme and a few plugins).

After some modifications on these repos, before upload to the server, I was needing a quick way to see what is deployed on the server.

This plugin is an alternative to connect with SSH, goto every directory and looking for the current state of the repo.



####Installation

In your OctoberCMS backend, go to Updates > Install plugins and search for "martin.gitreposmanager" or install from October Marketplace.



#### Usage
Start by adding all your repos from Backend > Settings > System > Git Repos Manager

After saving, the last commit information is loaded.

You need to manually update the repos to se the updated information.
